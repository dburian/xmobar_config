# My Xmobar config

My simple xmobar configuration contained in a single package.

## Install

To install simply clone this repo somewhere and run:

```bash
./rebuild.sh
cabal install
```

You should have `xmobar-x86_64-linux` among cabal's binaries. If you'd like
cabal to install into different directory you can specify it with `--installdir
<dir>`.
